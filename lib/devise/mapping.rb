module Devise
  # Responsible for handling devise mappings and routes configuration. Each
  # resource configured by devise_for in routes is actually creating a mapping
  # object. You can refer to devise_for in routes for usage options.
  #
  # The required value in devise_for is actually not used internally, but it's
  # inflected to find all other values.

  #   mapping = Devise.mappings[:user]
  #
  #   mapping.name #=> :user
  #   # is the scope used in controllers and warden, given in the route as :singular.
  #
  #   mapping.as   #=> "users"
  #   # how the mapping should be search in the path, given in the route as :as.
  #
  #   mapping.to   #=> User
  #   # is the class to be loaded from routes, given in the route as :class_name.
  #
  #   mapping.for  #=> [:authenticatable]
  #   # is the modules included in the class
